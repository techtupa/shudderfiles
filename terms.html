  <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
  <p>Last updated: October 2025</p>

  <p>This application, developed under TechTupa for the Shudder Files channel, automates the upload and management of video content through the TikTok API. By using this app, you agree that it may request permission to publish videos, read basic profile data, and manage your own TikTok content.</p>

  <p>No personal data is collected, stored, or shared by TechTupa beyond what is required for TikTok API authentication. The app acts only as a secure automation layer for authorized content creators.</p>

  <p>Use of this tool implies acceptance of TikTokâ€™s own Terms of Service and Developer Policy.</p>

  <p>For questions or requests regarding this integration, please contact: <a href="mailto:support@techtupa.com.br">support@techtupa.com.br</a></p>
